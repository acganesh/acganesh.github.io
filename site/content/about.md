I'm Adithya Ganesh, a technologist based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

I am a machine learning engineer at [Nuro](https://www.nuro.ai/), where I work on perception for self driving cars.  Previously, I studied math and computer science at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/).  Some of interests include machine learning, systems, and entrepreneurship.
