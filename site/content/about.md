I'm Adi Ganesh, a technologist based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

I work on research at [OpenAI](https://openai.com). Previously I worked on transformer models at [Meta](https://meta.com) and perception at [Nuro](https://www.nuro.ai/).  And before that I studied math and computer science at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/).  Some of my interests include machine learning, systems, and entrepreneurship.
