In this post, I'll document the workflow that I use to compose LaTeX documents locally on Mac OS.  Back in college I used this workflow to [live-TeX](https://amathew.wordpress.com/2010/07/07/my-adventure-in-live-texing-and-some-notes/) lecture notes.

Here's an example that shows it all together:

# Personal stylesheet

One of the most basic but powerful features of LaTeX is being able to define your own macros in a stylesheet.  I recommend defining your own, which you can then import with `\usepackage{stylesheetname}`.

The contents of mine are pretty simple -- I've attached it [here](https://github.com/acganesh/compendium/blob/master/adi.sty).

# latexmk: Auto-compilation 

Overleaf has this nice feature where it will recompile the document regularly as you edit.  There is a convenient Perl script that replicates this locally, called [`latexmk`](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html).  With the following command:

```
latexmk -pvc
```
the script will continuously check input files for changes and recompile the document if needed.

# vim-latex: Macros for LaTeX commands

I'm a longtime user of vim.  One of my favorite packages is [vim-latex](https://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/), which provides a handy set of macros.

You can find the full reference card [here](https://michaelgoerz.net/refcards/vimlatexqrc.pdf), but I'll highlight a few features that I find especially nice.

The package provides one-character macros for symbols.  For example, typing `6 will type out \partial.

There's also a handy feature for commands like \frac that require arguments.  Typing `/ will type out \frac{<++>}{<++>}{<++>}.  Each of the <++> are placeholders that can be "jumped" to with the command Ctrl-J.  This is probably a lot more clear in the GIF above :)

# Skim: Auto-reloading PDF viewer

On Mac OS, [Skim](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/) is a PDF reader which a key feature: it reloads when the PDF changes contents.  I find this nicer than Preview, which requires me to click on the window to get it to reload.

When I used to use a similar workflow on Linux, I used [zathura](https://github.com/pwmt/zathura), a lightweight document viewer with vim-like keybindings.

# tmux

I typically open a [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) session with latexmk in one pane, and my vim editor in a different pane.

# inkscape-figures

While it's possible to use TikZ to [generate beautiful images](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/158668/nice-scientific-pictures-show-off), I personally like creating vector graphics in inkscape, and then using the inkscape figures package to import them into my doc. For more information on this package, check out the [docs](https://github.com/gillescastel/inkscape-figures).
