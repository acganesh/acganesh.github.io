In this post, we'll explore how diffusion models work.  This post will follow the presentation in ["Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239).

# How do diffusion models work?

Diffusion models are Markov chains trained to produce samples matching the data after finite time.  We start with a diffusion process that destroys the data: we apply multiple Markov chain transitions until a datapoint `$\mathbf{x}_0$` gets gradually converted to noise.  Diffusion models learn transitions that reverse this process. 

Formally, diffusion models are latent variables of the form:
`$$p_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_0) = \int p_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_{0:T}) d \mathbf{x_{1:T}}$$`

Here, `$\mathbf{x}_1, \dots, \mathbf{x}_T$` are latent variables which are the same dimensionality as the data `$\mathbf{x}_0 \sim q(\mathbf{x}_0)$`.
